If you're using a NON-ENGLISH language in game you will also need to make sure that all your gearsets is named 
exactly as the auto-translation in the macros. From what I've noticed only people playing with French language is 
affected by this. For example, French players need to change their gearset names to all lowercase letters in 
order for the job macros to work.
